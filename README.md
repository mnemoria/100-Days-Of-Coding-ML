## Week 1
**Reviewing the fundamentals of Python, including topics such as variables, operations, control flow, commonly used data structures to ensure a solid understanding.**

### DAY 1
 - Palindrome checker
 - Simple command-line calculator
 - Expression calculator

### DAY 2

### DAY 3
 - Completed Week 1 to Week 3 of "Course 1: Crash Course on Python" from *Google IT Automation with Python* course
 - Command-line inventory management 

### DAY 4
 - Completed half of the contents for Week 4 of "Course 1: Crash Course on Python"
 - List comprehension practice problems

### DAY 5
 - Practiced in codewars.com. Solutions are posted on Day 5.

### DAY 6
 - Created an article on medium titled *"Unlocking the Power of Data Science: Mastering Python Fundamentals"* : https://medium.com/@MaryGrizelleHamor/unlocking-the-power-of-data-science-mastering-python-fundamentals-9217c3cc8a11
 - Tried a practice problem in codewars.com.

### DAY 7

## Week 2
**Learning Object-Oriented Programming in Python as well as commonly used Data Science modules such as Pandas**

### DAY 8
 - Watched and followed through half of ***freeCodeCamp***'s *"Object Oriented Programming with Python - Full Course for Beginners"* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_02ICOIgs
 - Started learning about the pandas library with ***Corey Schafer***'s "*Pandas Tutorial*": https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS
 - Looked through a lot of interesting dataset before I started exploring dataframes and I found ***Rachel Tatman***'s *Digimon datasets*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/digidb 

### DAY 9
 - Watched 30 minutes more of ***freeCodeCamp***'s *"Object Oriented Programming with Python - Full Course for Beginners"* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_02ICOIgs. Will be finishing the remaining time tomorrow.
 - Still improving my knowledge in OOP with Python while working with pandas library in the background.

### DAY 10
 - Completed ***freeCodeCamp***'s *"Object Oriented Programming with Python - Full Course for Beginners"* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_02ICOIgs.
 - Explored the difference between instance methods, class methods, and static methods more. 
 - Learned more about dunder methods.
 - Finished trying loc and iloc in pandas.
 - Side note: As a person who's familiar with how getters and setters work in Java, the pythonic way of writing getters and setters was really interesting! 

### DAY 11
 - Learned how to set, reset, and use indexes in Pandas
 - Read more about dunder methods, tried practicing some of it [init, new].
 - Tried exploring more about property decorators and learned that aside from getters and setters, there are also deleters.

### DAY 12
 - Tried filtering rows and columns using conditionals to find specific information. 

### DAY 13 
 - Created an article on medium titled *"Diving Deeper into Object-Oriented Programming with Python"* : https://medium.com/p/25141c8278d0
 - Learned how to update column names in pandas

### DAY 14
 - Practiced my Python skills on http://codewars.com. Was able to rank up from 8kyu to 7kyu.

## Week 3
**Creating a project to improve my proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming and the SOLID Principle.**

### DAY 15
 - Created the library's structure with the influence of the given schematic diagram:
